PHASE 1 Project Proposal

Story: 
One of my most enjoyed hobbies is playing the trading-card game, Yu-Gi-Oh! However, making and sharing deck-lists quickly has always been inconvenient. With this app I want to make a simple deck-building application.

Core Features of MVP: 
- Deck-builder will display the entire deck's card images in a grid fasion. 
- There will be a card-viewer to the right side of the screen where pressing a card from both the deck section and card-search section will display both the card image as well as the card text beneath it. The card viewer will also be how the user will edit their deck. 
- Card-search section where the user can search for cards and either add the card to the Main Deck, Side Deck, or Extra Deck. 

Stretch Goals:
- Total deck value/cost
	-robustness with user already having cards, special icon for this?

API: 
Yu-Gi-Oh! Pro Deck API

Challenges:
- Handling the complex data-base requirements (sections, within sections, within sections) while also holding functionality for GET, POST, PATCH, DELTE.
